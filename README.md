## Getting started

Start the GraphQL server with `yarn dev-server`.

Afterwards, start the NextJS server with `yarn dev`.

You can now open the web app on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and explore the GraphQL API on [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).

You will see an error for the web app, it will disappear when you solve part 1.
